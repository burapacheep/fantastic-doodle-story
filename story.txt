This is a story of the fantastic doodle island. Once upon the time, there was a little cat named Jojo. After came back from visiting another island, Jojo's mom is now seriously sick from deadly Carbonara virus. Jojo is really worried about this, but the island's prophet tells him that he can save his mom if he has a specific potion that can only find in Duo's island. However, Jojo can't simply get into that island because there is a double verification.

Unphased, Jojo prepared to sneak onto Duo's Island. He would do whatever it might take to get the potion to save his mom. Jojo knew that there were smugglers that liked to hang around the docks at night. He waited until nightfall, watching the docks, and sure enough, he spotted the smugglers. Jojo, attempting to be as casual as possible, began to walk toward the boat the smugglers were gathered around. Soon enough, he was in their midst. Knowing that there was not any time to lose, Jojo decided to speak up in a loud voice, asking "Who can take me to Duo's Island?" The smugglers were offput by the stranger who drew so much attention to himself. Cautious, as all smugglers are, they began to shuffle away. Within five minutes, they were all gone, except one. The final smuggler approached Jojo, and said "I can take you past the island, but I'm not stoppin'. I'll get you close enough, but you're gonna have to swim the rest of the way yourself." Jojo instantly agreed, knowing that he had no other choice. His one problem--Jojo was petrified of the water.
